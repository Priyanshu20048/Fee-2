                    Good vibes, good life. If you have read any self help book before then don't 
                    bother with this one.It adds nothing new and you will have heard it all before,
                     well the good bits.The book tries to 
                    arrange the same old self help advice 
                    around  'the law of vibration' and 'the law of attraction'.
                    Firstly the law of vibration is all well and good, we are all vibrating. Nothing in the universe
                    is ever still, I'm on board with that. However, Vex King goes on to say how our own vibrations our
                    thoughts, our mood and 
                    even the food we eat  can impact the universe around us.
                     Which brings us onto
                    'the law of attraction' which states that if you want something, then by focusing on it and 
                    visualising it the "universe will rearrange itself for you" and
                     "the universe will always support you

                Atomic Habits succeeded in bringing awareness to my daily habits and making me more 'present'. The likes 
                of “habit stacking” and “habit tracking” are things that I have started implementing since reading this. 
                But while it’s great to be self-aware and regularly analyse our behaviours, I found it
                 tiresome after a while.
                James Clear gives many examples of famous people who achieved success via their approach to habits. I enjoyed 
                reading some of those,
                 but far too often, content felt like it was being regurgitated from other books and work
                in the field of habits and human psychology. Sometimes it felt like he had simply thrown catchy new titles on 
                pre-existing ideas and methods. Other times, it just seemed like common sense.The book is not just about developing
                 good habits and sticking to them, but about eliminating bad ones. I was pleased to see reference to Allen Carr’s 
                 Easy Way to Stop Smoking – a book that already made a huge difference to my life! The importance of patience,
                the difference between 'motion'/'action' and the two-minute rule when starting a new habit, it should take less
                than two minutes to do were all takeaways that resonated with me.

                    I liked the message of this book and the concept of ikigai, but I found the book focused more on longevity
                     and how centenarians claim they were able to live so long. It was mashed together strangely and didn’t
                      flow well. There were chapters describing step by step how to do a sun salutation or some basic movements
                       of tai chi, which I felt was just unnecessary way to fill up some pages. I listened to the audiobook, and
                        was disappointed by how horribly the narrator pronounced Japanese terms. Overall, this book attempted to
                         offer some good advice, but it needed to expand more on the core focus of ikigai.In this book, the term 
                         ikigai is translated as the bliss of always being busy. Ikigai is actually a combination of your passion,
                          your mission and your profession. This book answers some basic questions as to why some people keep doing 
                          what they have been doing for years tirelessly even though it's the same things over and over again, say, 
                          actors, writers, bloggers, artists and so on. Why do some people never get bored or frustrated repeating doing
                           the same things over and over again?

                    This book may do a good job of getting you excited about your financial future but the false information it teaches negates any benefits.
I believe this book does a disservice to the public. I suspect it was written to appeal to those who are failing in the world's conventional definition of success. Didn't go to college? Can't hold down a stable job? Good for you! You haven't fallen for that waste of time and stupid rat race like all those other suckers!
Saying that higher education isn't worthwhile is misleading. I agree it isn't essential (and possibly not even helpful in rare circumstances), but the high correlation in the general public between education and wealth cannot be ignored.
He also gives poor advice in finances and investing. For example, not adhering to diversification. Or getting out of a stable job (a.k.a. "rat race") where "even if you win you're still a rat."
The author praises learning correct accounting but then proceeds to butcher even the most fundamentals. For example, his first rule is "You must know the difference between an asset and a liability" but then he proceeds to claim that your home is a liability, not an asset. Completely backwards. Any accountant will tell you so.
The book is full of exaggerated and sometimes completely false anecdotes -- for example, it appears the entire premise of the book is false -- there never was a rich dad and Robert wasn't wealthy until he embraced MLM and started selling get-rich books.

                        As I finish reading Sundar Kand (Hindi translation) by Goswami Tulsidas, my head is bowed in reverence to Lord Ram, Goddess Sita and their greatest servitor of all - Lord Hanuman. Despite my ill health, an unusual calmness & joy envelopes me. I find myself humming the couplets from this beautiful poem (which finds place in the fifth canto of the classical epic story of the Ramayana known as Sri Ram Charit Manas by Tulsidas).
The inquisitiveness to know Lord Hanuman and worship Him is a legacy left behind by my mother, who was an ardent devotee of Lord Hanuman.
Having read Sundar Kand a few times before, and hearing of it’s acclaimed spiritual significance, a strong desire to know and understand it’s meaning & true essence lead me to order this Hindi translation.
The Sundar Kand symbolizes the dawn of hope after a dark night of hopelessness and despair, because it is in this Canto that Sita is traced by Hanuman after Lord Ram had lost all hopes of finding her, thus instilling hope in the heart of both Lord Ram and Goddess Sita that they would now be united once again. It is also here that Vibhishan, the brother of Ravana, too finds a way to his freedom and redemption from the evil of being called a demon by the virtue of his birth in this race, because he goes to surrender before Lord Ram and is warmly welcomed by him.

                            The Bhagavad Gita, often referred to as the Gita, is a 700 verse Hindu scripture in Sanskrit that is part of the Hindu epic Mahabharata (chapters 23–40 of the 6th book of Mahabharata).
The Gita is set in a narrative framework of a dialogue between Pandava prince Arjuna and his guide and charioteer Krishna.
At the start of the Dharma Yudhha (righteous war) between Pandavas and Kauravas, Arjuna is filled with moral dilemma and despair about the violence and death the war will cause in the battle against his own kin.
He wonders if he should renounce and seeks Krishna's counsel, whose answers and discourse constitute the Bhagavad Gita.
Krishna counsels Arjuna to "fulfill his Kshatriya (warrior) duty to uphold the Dharma" through "selfless action".
